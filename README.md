# NETWORK SCIENCE BASED APPROACH TO ANALYZING EMAIL DATA
As part of the academic curriculum of M.Sc Computer Science, University of Delhi, I submit this work as a joint collaborator for the partial fulfillment for 
the coursework of the Network Science coursework.
The project comprises of 2 distinct components:
<ol>
<li>Data retrieval and analysis of email data primarily for identifying the central node in the network
through degree distribution network attribute.</li>
<li>Identifying communitites in the dataset using KL Algorithm and Girvan-Newman Algorithm respectively.</li>
<br>
In both the above cases, visualization has been primarily done using Cytoscape.

Further details regarding each of the components have been elaborated in the submission PDFs present in the respective directories.
